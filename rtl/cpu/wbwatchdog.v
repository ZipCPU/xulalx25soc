// Filename:	wbwatchdog.v
//
// Project:	Zip CPU -- a small, lightweight, RISC CPU soft core
//
// Purpose:	A Zip timer, redesigned to be a bus watchdog
//
//	This is a **really** stripped down Zip Timer.  All options for external
//	control have been removed.  This timer may be reset, and ... that's 
//	about it.  The goal is that this stripped down timer be used as a bus
//	watchdog element.  Even at that, it's not really fully featured.  The
//	rest of the important features can be found in the zipsystem module.
//
//	As a historical note, the wishbone watchdog timer began as a normal
//	timer, with some fixed inputs.  This makes sense, if you think about it:
//	if the goal is to interrupt a stalled wishbone transaction by inserting
//	a bus error, then you can't use the bus to set it up or configure it
//	simply because the bus in question is ... well, unreliable.  You're
//	trying to make it reliable.
//
//	The problem with using the ziptimer in a stripped down implementation
//	was that the fixed inputs caused the synthesis tool to complain about
//	the use of registers values would never change.  This solves that
//	problem by explicitly removing the cruft that would otherwise
//	just create synthesis warnings and errors.
